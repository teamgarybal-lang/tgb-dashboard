# Harcourts TGB Group – Team Dashboard

Node.js (Express) + SQLite (`data.db`). Port 3100. Run under pm2 as `tgb-dashboard` (`ecosystem.config.js`).

- `/login` – agents and admin sign in (email + password, 180-day session cookie, bcrypt-hashed passwords)
- `/me` – agent phone view (+1 buttons, editable totals, today status, pipeline, own history)
- `/admin` – Gary: team totals vs last week, per-agent table, week picker, missing list, CSV export, add/reset/deactivate/delete agents, weekly targets, TV key
- `/tv?key=...` – office TV board, no login, refreshes every 12 s. Key is regenerated from /admin.
- Weeks run Monday–Sunday, Pacific/Auckland time. Pipeline carries forward into a new week until updated.
- Admin temporary password: `ADMIN_PASSWORD.txt` (change it after first sign-in).

Ops: `pm2 ls`, `pm2 logs tgb-dashboard`, `pm2 restart tgb-dashboard`. Backup = copy `data.db`.

## Public hosting
Cloudflare quick tunnels can't run from this box (outbound port 7844 is blocked). SSH tunnels (localhost.run, pinggy) and localtunnel are blocked too.
Permanent options:
1. Render / Railway / Fly.io: deploy this folder (`npm install && node server.js`) with a persistent disk mounted for `data.db` (SQLite needs a disk; on Render the free plan has no disk, so use the paid Starter plan with a disk, or Fly.io with a volume).
2. Named Cloudflare Tunnel from any always-on PC/mini-PC in the office: `cloudflared tunnel login` → `cloudflared tunnel create tgb` → route DNS `team.<gary-domain>` → `cloudflared tunnel run`. This needs a domain on Gary's Cloudflare account.
3. Quick test from any computer with internet: `node server.js` and then `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3100` (the URL changes every restart).
